   Splicing Analysis Kit (Spanki) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Example code for performing simulationsOverview==============Below is a basic guide to running simulations with Spanki.  It uses the test dataset avaliable at: http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/spanki/testdata.tar.gzGetting started===============Spanki's simulator uses models generated from permissive Bowtie mapping.  To build cutom models, Spanki requires Bowtie alignments in map format.If you don't wish to build custom models, you can jump straight to "Simulating transcripts"Retrieve and decompress testdata.tar.gz in a working directory, and run the commands below to try these examplesBuilding models===============The program 'spankisim_models' will make error models from a Bowtie map file.See http://bowtie.cbcb.umd.edu for information about making Bowtie map files.Note that spankisim_models is a standalone perl script.  It doesn't require any external libraries, so it's possible to send it to a cluster to run separately.Here is how to generate models, using the example map file included in the test dataset.   spankisim_models -i testdata/example.map -ends 2 -l 76 -o example_modelRunning a sim===============You can simulate reads from transcripts using the 'spankisim_transcripts' program.  It can use a built-in error model, or your own custom model.  Please see the Spanki manual for more details on parameters and output.Here is an example of simulating transcripts using a pre-built model ('flyheads', from an RNA-SEQ experiment on Drosophila heads)  spankisim_transcripts -o sim_flyheads -g testdata/annotation/genemodels.gtf -f testdata/fasta/myref.fa -bp 76 -m flyheads -cov 5 -ends 2  Here is an example of using the custom model, built in the preceding step:  spankisim_transcripts -o sim_custom -g testdata/annotation/genemodels.gtf -f testdata/fasta/myref.fa -bp 76 -m custom -mdir example_model -cov 5 -ends 2
